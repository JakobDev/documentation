# External data checker

The Flatpak External Data Checker is a tool that can be used to check for updates to external data sources. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [Flathub](https://flathub.org) build system, but can be used with any Flatpak repository.

It can be found in the [flatpak-external-data-checker](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-external-data-checker) repository.

Please refer to the readme in the repo for further assistance.
