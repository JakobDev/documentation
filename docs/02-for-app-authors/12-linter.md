# Flatpak builder lint

The Flatpak builder lint tool is a linter for Flatpak manifests. It's used to check for common errors, to enforce a consistent style and permissions.
It can be found in the [flatpak-builder-lint](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint) repository.

It's run against all builds send to Flathub, and can be run locally to check your manifest before submitting it. You can find more information in the readme.
