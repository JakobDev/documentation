# Shared modules

Shared modules are a collection of modules that are frequently used by applications and where it makes sense to share the maintenance burden.

Shared modules live in the [shared-modules repository](https://github.com/flathub/shared-modules).

Please refer to the readme in the repo for further assistance.
