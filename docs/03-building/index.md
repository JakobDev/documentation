# Building

This section contains detailed information on how to build applications
as Flatpaks. It starts with an overview of the build process, before
diving into requirements for applications, guidance on key decisions,
information on how to use `flatpak-builder`, and how to write manifest
files.

If you haven't already, it is recommended to run through
[first build](../getting-started/first-build) before reading this section.
