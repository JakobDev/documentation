# Publishing

Flatpak provides several ways to distribute applications to users. For
many applications, the most convenient and effective method is to use
[Flathub](https://flathub.org), which provides a large centralized
repository of Flatpak applications.

Alternatively, it is possible to host a repository yourself, or to
distribute Flatpaks as single file bundles.
