# For users

## Introduction

Flatpak is a universal package format for Linux desktop applications. It is
available on most Linux distributions. It allows you to install and run
applications in a sandboxed environment, separate from the rest of the
system. This sandboxing gives you more control over the dependencies of
your applications.

## Installation

Please refer to the Flatpak installation instructions for your distribution over at [flatpak.org](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

These instructions should also show you how to install the Flathub repository.
